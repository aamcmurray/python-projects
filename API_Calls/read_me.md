# Using the NISRA API

Scripts here are used to pull data from the new NISRA data portal (https://data.nisra.gov.uk/) using Python. 

Can pull a list of updated tables since a given date and retrieve either .json or .csv format data which is converted to a pandas dataframe for further analysis. 

User input currently does not have validation layers may also make a GUI.
