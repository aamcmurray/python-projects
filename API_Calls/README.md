# A. Py. I v1

NISRA_Beta.py is a Python script that retrieves a list of data sets available at [NISRA](https://data.nisra.gov.uk/)

It can be run as an executable from command line and accepts user input. Select a dataset by index to download the dataset as a .csv to the current location. A preview of the data set will also be shown.

NISA_API_2.ipynb shows some of the functions used in NISRA_Beta.py being applied in a Jupyter Notebook.
