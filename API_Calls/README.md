[NISRA_Beta.py](https://github.com/aamcmurray/python-projects/blob/master/API_Calls/NISRA_Beta.py) is a Python script that retrieves a list of data sets available at [NISRA](https://data.nisra.gov.uk/)

It accepts user input. Select a dataset by index to download the dataset as a .csv to the current location. A preview of the data set will also be shown.

[NISA_API_2.ipynb](https://github.com/aamcmurray/python-projects/blob/master/API_Calls/NISA_API_2.ipynb) shows some of the functions used in NISRA_Beta.py being applied in a Jupyter Notebook.

The programme is currently very simple however in future updates will enable selection of date ranges, downloads by reference code and data will be sorted by category rather than date of the last update. 

This programme, or functions within it, should be useful to anybody who needs to access the same data sets repeatedly at defined time intervals (for instance to update dashboards or produce similar reports over time).
